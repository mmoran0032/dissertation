Chapter 1
=========

Energy diagram for the 27Al(p,a)24Mg reaction

-   Show major resonances accessible when studying at zero degrees


Chapter 2
=========

Schematic of the Wien filter

-   crossed electric/magnetic fields

Locations of diagnostics within St. George

-   slits (S), faraday cups (F), and quartz viewers (Q)

Faraday cup designs

-   both FN and 5U version


Chapter 3
=========

Beam divergence from quadrupole

-   changing focal position based on magnetic strength

Beam steering from misaligned Beam

-   beam looks to move left and right as field strength changed


Chapter 4
=========

Alpha distribution at detector

-   include both optimized and not-optimized distributions

Detector positions

-   Show strips, in-beam and below beam positions, basic


Chapter 5
=========

Simulated alpha spectrum

-   include comparison to experimental data


Chapter 6
=========

Si strip orientation

-   this could be handled by "Detector positions" figure in Ch04?
