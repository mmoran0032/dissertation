s-PROCESS
=========

The s-process requires a low neutron flux and operates on a timescale where the
capture process is slow compared to the beta-decay, so the neutron capture
happens after the beta-decay takes place. The creation of new nuclei moves along
the valley of stability. (Battistini & Bensby, 2015; B2FH 1957)

The s-process produces roughly half of the elements between Fe and Bi and can
occur in massive stars, in the He burning core, the convective C burning shell,
and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars evolved from lower mass stars at solar
or lower metallicity. (Battistini & Bensby, 2015; Pignatari et al, 2010,
Bisterzo et al, 2011)

Most of the s-process elements between Fe and Sr are produced in massive (M > 8)
stars and contribute to the weak s-process, while the main s-process takes place
in AGB stars (1.3 < M < 8). (Pignatari et al, 2010; Kappeler et al, 1989; Beer
et al, 1992)

The main source of neutrons in massive stars is the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction which
turns of at the end of the convective He burning core and in the following
convective C burning shell. (Pignatari et al, 2010; Peters 1968; Couch et al,
1974; Lamb et al, 1977; Prantzos et al 1990; Raiteri et al 1991b; Raiteri et al,
1991a)

The s-process activates once the central temperature of the He core is higher
than 0.25 GK with the 22Ne(a,n)25Mg reaction, which exhausts the supply of alpha
particles. (Pignatari et al, 2010)

Since not all 22Ne is used up, the s-process is reactivated during C burning,
with additional alpha particles provided by the 12C(12C,a)20Ne reaction.
(Pignatari et al, 2010; Prantzos et al, 1990; Arnett & Truran, 1969; Raiteri et
al, 1991a)

The 22Ne(a,n) reaction powers the weak component of the s-process, responsible
for nucleosynthesis in the mass range A = 60-90. (Goerres et al, 2000; 4; 5)

This second s-process takes place in the convective shell, since any C burning
nucleosynthesis in the core will collapse following the SN explosion, and the
neutron flux and exposure are comparable to that during He burning. (Pignatari
et al, 2010; Raiteri et al, 1991a)

1.1 -- end of section: need transition saying just focusing on just this
        reaction


1.2 -- energies relevant to burning processes
    -   globally cross section decreases due to Coulomb barrier
    -   s-factor used since cross section drops dramatically
        -   l=0 of coulomb barrier removed
    -   low energies in stars, so Gamow window
    -   reaction rate
    -   resonances and reaction rate specific to it
        -   resonance strength here

Advantage: define quantities that are global, then move to specifics
beef up definition of resonance

define radiativve capture earlier

recoil separators are needed to measure stuff, and that stuff is important

justify the work that I'm going to present

conclude chapter with: how do we determine if a separator is working, and
how do we use it to measure reactions?
-   transition saying this is what's going to happen next
