I would like to thank my advisor, Dr.\ Michael Wiescher, for assigning
me to the St.\ George project and many others along the way. He was a
great help as I explored and discovered my path in science and in life.
For all of his work and guidance to get St.\ George to where it is now,
I would like to thank Dr.\ Manoel Couder. He was always a resource for
questions about mass separator theory, design, and operation, and the
primary guiding force behind the completion of this work, and a support
throughout the entire process. I would also like to thank the remainder
of my committee, Drs.\ Daniel Bardayan, Mark Caprio, and John LoSecco, for guiding
me through the candidacy and defense process.

The entirety of this project would be impossible without the excellent
support I had throughout the Nuclear Science Lab and the Department of
Physics. In particular, Dr.\ Daniel Robertson and Dr.\ Edward Stech were
invaluable for learning standard operating procedures throughout the
lab, especially with the accelerators, targets, and detector systems,
and how to be a graduate student within the NSL. Thank you to Jerry
Schur, both for helping me with every network problem that I happened to
forget the solution to at precisely the wrong time. Thank you to the
amazing work done both within and without the machine shop from Dave
Futa, Jerry Lingle, Bradley Mulder, and Matt Sanford. There have been
more times than I could count where this project would not have moved
forward without you. Thank you to the excellent support from Susan
Baxmeyer and Shari Herman, who never failed to cheer me up when I saw
them in the office and who helped me navigate through the parts of
graduate school life that I had no idea of what to do otherwise.

Thank you to the greater St.\ George group, past and
present\textemdash{} Dr.\ Manoel Couder, Dr.\ Jerry Hinnefeld Dr.\ Zach
Meisel, Gwen Gilardy, Patricia Huestis, Edward Lamere, Luis Morales,
Shane Moylan, and Chris Seymour\textemdash{}for being the support for
when tuning went poorly and the source of jubilation when things went
well. To those future graduate students and postdocs within the group, I
thank you for taking this project on your own shoulders, and I hope this
is a decent starting point for your own work.

Thank you to Will Bauder, Stephanie Lyons Blyth, Matt Bowers, Hyu Soon
Jung, Wenting Liu, Alex Long, Karen Ostdiek, Karl Smith, Kiana
Setoodhar, and Ethan Uberseder, my former group mates, co-graduate
students, office mates, and guiding older scientists, for helping me as
I struggled to figure out who I was as a scientist and for helping me
when the work of physics became too much.

To those close friends that I've made in graduate school\textemdash{}
Will Bauder, Clark Casarella, Jared Coughlin, Edward Lamere, Charlie
Mueller, Michael Planer, Jacee Rohlk, Alicia Spect, MacKenzie Warren,
and Chris Wotta\textemdash{}thank you for everything. You've each
impacted my life in so many different ways that listing everything out
would triple the length of this dissertation. You are better than I
could have imagined as the people going through this process with me.
Thank you to Pokie and Mike Olsen, for allowing a young graduate student
into your home and for reawakening my love of board games. I can barely
remember a time before I had to struggle to pay for a 6-cost
development, and I didn't fully appreciate how amazing it was until you
left. Thank you to Kate Turk, for helping me survive graduate school in
more ways than one. You\textemdash{}and of course, your dog
Maxwell\textemdash{}have done so much for me, and I don't think I could
ever come close to repaying you. Thank you again to MacKenzie Warren,
who deserved his own mention, for being the sounding board of my
thoughts and feelings from our time together as roommates through the
present day. You've shown me that people can survive graduate school and
come out better from it. Thank you also to all of those within my
graduate cohort and in the physics department as a whole that I met,
joked with, confided in, or just had a good time with. Your names are
far too numerous to list here.

Thank you to my friends from Michigan State, Nichole Hoerner, Gregory
Klein, Christopher Schuster, and Ashleigh Winkelmann. Our continued
friendship over the years has made me realize how lucky I was to
stumbled into your lives.

Thank you to my family\textemdash{}my parents, Mike and Brigette, my
sisters Caitlin and Colleen, and my brother Patrick\textemdash{}for
always being there to bring a smile back onto my face during holidays
and family trips to the cider mill. You have shaped me so much as a
person during my life, and I know that I am the person I am now because
of how amazing you are as a family. Thank you also to my extended
family, scattered across the states and sometimes the world as they are,
for keeping me in check when I thought to highly or lowly of myself and
my life.

Thank you to Link, for being the derpy sunshine at the end of my
graduate career and for allowing me to laugh at your antics both in the
apartment and outside of it.

Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Laura Amelia, for being there.
When you entered my life during my first year of graduate school, I
could not have predicted to drastic positive change you made in my life.
You have gotten me through graduate school in more ways than one, and I
could not have done all of this without you by my side. While this part
of our lives is now over, I am excited to begin our next stage together
as we leave Notre Dame behind. I love you with all of my being, and I
thank you for sticking with me.
