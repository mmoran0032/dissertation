Proton resonances in 28Si from E_x = 12.5 to 13.4 MeV

-   in the energy range E_p = 0.92 - 1.85 MeV, only the (p,p0) and (p,a0)
    channels contribute strongly
-   we care about proton capture studies
-   mention the energy calibration (which 27Al(p,g) resonance?)
-   since the ground state spin-parity of 27Al is 5/2+, the elastic
    scattering channel spins are s=2 and 3 (?)
-   our reaction exit channel has spin 0+ -> no mixing for alpha decay
    -   only natural parity states can decay through the a0 channel
-   resonance parameters:
    -   E_p = 1.1841 MeV (Gamma and gamma in keV)::

            Jpi l   Gammap  gammap  la0 Gammaa0 gammaa0
            2+  0   0.25    34      2   0.41    74

    -   E_p = 1.3656 MeV::

            Jpi l   Gammap  gammap  la0 Gammaa0 gammaa0
            2+  0   0.55    11      2   0.40    36

Particle Decays in 28Si: The destruction of 27Al in red giants and novae

-   at elevated temperatures (T9 >= 0.08), 26Al and 27Al may be connected
    by the reaction sequence::

        27Al(p,a)24Mg(p,g)25Al(b+)25Mg(p,g)26Al(p,g)27Si(b+)27Al

-   sequence is within the MgAl cycle
-   during hydrogen burning, 27Al is destroyed via 27Al(p,a)24Mg and
    27Al(p,g)28Si reactions which, respectively, close the MgAl cycle and
    allow leakage out of the cycle
-   energy range of interest for red giants and novae is below Ecm = 284 keV
-   MgAl cycle can't be confirmed with current uncertainties
