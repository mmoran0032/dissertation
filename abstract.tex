    The St.\ George recoil separator is currently undergoing its final
    commissioning work to fully characterize it ahead of the first experimental
    campaign to study $(\alpha,\gamma)$ reactions of astrophysical interest.
    The work currently completed to that end and comparison to the expected
    operation will be discussed. A single campaign utilizing the first two
    main sections of St.\ George to study two strong resonances in the
    \alpa{} has been completed as an initial test of the combined angular and
    energy acceptance of th separator, the rejection properties of the Wien
    filter, and the exploration of the use of St.\ George for studying other
    astrophysically important reaction types. The results and comparison to
    accepted values will be presented alongside the extensions to other
    reactions and considerations for extending the analysis capabilities of the
    separator.
