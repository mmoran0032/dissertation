Introduction
============

The study of nuclear reactions and the measurement of the cross sections of
those reactions has been a modern and growing aspect of experimental physics.

- talk about basic regimes of study
- talk about facilities
- transition to sections below


Nuclear Astrophysics
--------------------

The specific and directed study of those nuclear reactions that have an effect
on the properties or life cycle of celestial bodies is grouped under the
umbrella term *nuclear astrophysics*.

- different parts of nuclear astrophysics
- stellar burning
- s-process
- stellar lifecycle
- cross section
- reaction rate
- R-matrix (?)




Recoil Separation

- what it is
- what it is used to study
- how does it work
- why is it effective
