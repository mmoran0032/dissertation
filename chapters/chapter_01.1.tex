\section{Nuclear Astrophysics}
\label{sec:ch01-nuclear-astrophysics}

The specific and directed study of those nuclear reactions that have an effect
on the properties or life cycle of celestial bodies can be grouped under the
umbrella term \emph{nuclear astrophysics}. These reactions may take place
during the lifecycle of a star, during a cataclysmic event within the universe
such as a black hole merger or gamma ray burst, or at the beginning of the
universe itself. Additionally, the decay of various isotopes can also play a
major role within this domain, either as part of a sequence of reactions or
independently.

\subsection{Hydrogen Burning}

The processes by which \nuc{1}{H} can be combined to form \nuc{4}{He} are
called \emph{hydrogen burning processes}, or simply \emph{hydrogen burning}.

\section{Recoil Separation}
\label{sec:ch01-recoil-separation}

The experimental process in which the reaction products produced by a direct
beam can be filtered out from that direct beam in order to be detected is
called \emph{recoil separation} or alternatively \emph{recoil mass separation}.
A recoil separator is the system, consisting of a sequence of electromagnetic
elements, designed to perform this task.
