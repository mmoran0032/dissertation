Thesis Outline
==============

#.  Introduction
    -   Some information on (a,g) and (p,a) reactions
    -   Fair bit of science, but doesn't need to start from scratch
    -   Provide background for the rest of the thesis

#.  Experimental Setup

        #.  Single Ray Transport

    #.  Diagnostic Equipment
    #.  Magnet Recycling

#.  Alpha Production Runs (*tentative title*)
    #.  Experimental Considerations
    #.  Alpha Beamspot Considerations
    #.  Altered Transport Tune
