\chapter{POLE TIP FIELDS}

For the two possible reaction study settings for St.\ George, the fields
required are different. The difference arises from the difference in required
recoil properties at the post-Wien filter focal plane $F_2$. The pole tip field
settings for $(\alpha,\gamma)$ experiments are from using a mass $A = 41$
recoil in charge state $Q = 11^+$ with rigidities $B\rho = 0.331$~Tm and
$E\rho = 2.836$~MV (see Figure~\ref{fig:raytrace} for more details).
