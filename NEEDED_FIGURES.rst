Chapter 1
=========

Energy diagram for the 27Al(p,a)24Mg reaction

-   Show major resonances accessible when studying at zero degrees

-   Picture I have in my head is from TUNL, but only goes up to mass 20


Chapter 2
=========

Use figure from Meisel et al, 2017
.. 5U schematic
.. -   basics: ion source, terminal, acceleration tube, analyzing magnet
.. -   include basic transport line? I think I make a reference to it in
..     chapter 3

Schematic of the Wien filter

-   crossed electric/magnetic fields

-   show view from above

.. Locations of diagnostics within St. George
.. -   slits (S), faraday cups (FC), and quartz viewers (QV)
.. -   we have the STG schematic already, just need to edit the figure

Faraday cup designs

-   both FN and 5U version


Chapter 3
=========

Location of steerers? I think I can group this in with the 5U schematic

Rethink how to show the quads in two figures

.. Completed 2018-08-21 (really shitty, but that's fine)

.. Beam divergence from quadrupole
.. -   changing focal position based on magnetic strength
.. Beam steering from misaligned Beam
.. -   beam looks to move left and right as field strength changed


Chapter 4
=========

Alpha distribution at detector

-   from ``python``

-   include both optimized and not-optimized distributions (?)

.. Detector positions
.. -   Show strips, in-beam and below beam positions, basic


Chapter 5
=========

Simulated alpha spectrum

-   from ``python``

-   include comparison to experimental data


Chapter 6
=========

Use figure in Ch04

.. Si strip orientation
.. -   this could be handled by "Detector positions" figure in Ch04?
.. -   Yes, let's just use that figure.
